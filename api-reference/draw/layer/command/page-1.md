This enum is used to toggle rendering modes.

### normal﻿ <a href="#normal" id="normal"></a>

Field

Normal, opaque rendering. All polygons will get filled with color, and texture sampling will be fully supported. This is the default mode to render shapes in layer.

### wireframe﻿ <a href="#wireframe" id="wireframe"></a>

Field

Wireframe rendering. This means that the polygons will no longer be filled with color, nor texture sampling will ever work.

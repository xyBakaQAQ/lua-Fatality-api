# events\_t

This module lets you manage custom in-game event listener.

> ####
>
> Please note that the game server knows which events you are listening to. Internally, we only listen to events that will get sent to the client anyway in one way or another. If you decide to listen to something the server generally does not expect, it may cause issues on official servers.
